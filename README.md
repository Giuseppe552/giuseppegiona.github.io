# 🕶️ Giuseppe Giona — Building Systems, Securing Futures, Staying Positive

I work on tools that strip noise, uncover signals, and make businesses harder to break — technically and financially.  

My background sits between numbers and systems: from writing code that cleans hidden metadata to frameworks that save companies **£50k+ a year in wasted inefficiency**. The common thread? Precision.  

I don’t see technology as just code — it’s leverage. The right system compounds, the right security protects, and the right mindset sustains. That’s what I share here: experiments, insights, and tools built in public.  

This site is my notebook and my signal. If you’re reading this, you probably value clarity, resilience, and growth the same way I do.
