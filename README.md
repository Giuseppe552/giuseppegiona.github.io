# 🕶️ Giuseppe Giona — Building Systems, Securing Futures, Staying Positive

Welcome to my personal site.  
I’m a **Mathematics graduate**, AI & Security engineer-in-progress, and founder of **Alveriano — B2B Strategy Solutions**.  
I build **scalable systems** that eliminate inefficiency, apply **AI for security & automation**, and share what I learn here.  

This GitHub Pages site is both my **public notebook** and **business card**.  
Think of it as my hacker-style LinkedIn — but stripped of fluff, focused on depth, and designed for people who want to think at scale.
